The most important package is bundler
    which helps us to bundle or compress our code before sending it to the production.
    when we use create react app it uses webpack as a bundler in the backend 

Types of dependencies(packages):
    -Dev dependencies
    -normal dependencies

Installing dependencies into our project:
    for example npm install -D parcel
    why -D?
        Because we wants to download the developement phase dependecy not the production phase dependency 

"parcel": "^2.15.2": what is ^?:
    we can also write it as a  ~2.15.2
    whats the difference for an exmple current version is 2.15.2
    now we have ^ and the version updated to 2.15.4 so ^ will update but ~ will not update minor update,
    now we have ~ and the version updated to 3.1.1 so ~ will update but the ^ will not update the major verison
